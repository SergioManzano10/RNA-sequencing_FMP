# RNA sequencing role in the genetic diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
This repository contains the code used to carry out the final master project titled: **RNA sequencing role in the genetic diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.**

## RNA-seq
* The first step was to run the RNA-seq pipeline using Nextflow. To achieve this, we created a nextflow.config file, which can be found in the BASH scripts folder under the name nextflow_rnaseq.config.
